Variable converstion between two datasets:
PAX counter -> Volume

points:
1. definition of dormant lounge can be if recently there was no new record out of that AND no one is reported to be there (if exit of PAX is submitted)

Things specifically for new dataset (undone yet):
1. Calculate the current number of Passengers and show that
2. there are classes there

Make the code modular where:
1. a database connector is seperated
2. javascript, html, css codes are seperated
